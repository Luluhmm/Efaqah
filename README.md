# Efaqah — AI-Powered Stroke Detection Platform

# Project Description:
    Efaqah is a clinical web platform for early stroke detection. It gives care teams a single workflow to:
      Classify head CT scans with a CNN model (≈97% reported accuracy),
      Estimate symptom-based risk with a tabular ML model (≈92% reported accuracy),
      Review both signals together, document, and follow up.

# User Storeis: 
  - Nurse: 
    - As a nurse, I want to add a new patient profile (name, age, ID, contact info, etc ) so that the doctor has the case ready for review.  
    - As a nurse, I want to assign a patient to a specific doctor so that the doctor can follow up with their case directly.
    - As a nurse, I want to update or correct patient details so that the records stay accurate and up to date.
    - As a nurse, I want to quickly search patients by name, ID, or phone number so that I can easily find and manage their profiles.
    - As a nurse, I want to open a patient’s profile and view their full details so that I can provide accurate and complete information to the doctor.
    - As a nurse, I want to see on my dashboard how many total patients I have, how many new patients were added today, and how many patients are currently under a doctor’s care so that I can track workload and patient flow efficiently.

  - Doctor: 
      - As a doctor, I want to see a list of my patients so that I can manage and follow up with their cases.
      - As a doctor, I want to search for my patients by name, ID, or phone number  so that I can quickly locate a specific patient.
      - As a doctor, I want to see the latest CT scans, symptoms so that I can make timely decisions.
      - As a doctor, I want to view a patient’s general details (persnoal info, contact info, lastest diagnoses (symptoms and CT scan)) so that I have a quick overview of the patient.
      - As a doctor, I want to view a patient’s complete medical history (scans and symptoms over time) so that I can track disease progression and treatment response.
      - As a doctor, I want to download a patient’s medical history and records as a CSV file so that I can analyze or share them with other healthcare providers.
      - As a doctor, I want to upload a patient’s CT scan so that the system can analyze it for stroke detection.
      - As a doctor, I want to see the stroke detection result from the CT scan with a confidence percentage so that I can validate the system’s findings.
      - As a doctor, I want to enter key patient symptoms and risk factors (gender, age, residence, marital status, work type, smoking status, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI) so that the system can calculate stroke risk.
      - As a doctor, I want to see both the CT scan analysis and symptom-based stroke risk % on one screen so that I can make faster and more reliable clinical decisions.
      - As a doctor, I want to see key stats on my dashboard (total patients, critical cases, new patients, clinical alerts, and recent diagnoses) so that I can monitor workload and prioritize urgent cases.

  - Manager of An Hospital:
    - As manager, I want to view the available subscription plans (Basic, Pro, Enterprise, etc.) so that I can select the one that fits my hospital’s needs.
    - As a manager, I want to subscribe my hospital to a plan so that we can start using the system.
    - As a manager, I want to add new doctors with their details so that they can start managing patients.
    - As a manager, I want to view and edit doctor information so that I can keep their records accurate and up to date.
    - As a manager, I want to delete a doctor’s profile so that I can remove inactive or incorrect records.
    - As a manager, I want to add new nurses with their details so that they can support doctors in managing patients.

    - As a manager, I want to delete a nurse’s profile so that I can remove inactive or incorrect records.
    - As a manager, I want to add, view and edit patient information so that I can ensure data consistency across the system.
    - As a manager, I want to delete a patient’s record when necessary so that the database remains clean and accurate.
    - As a manager, I want to see key stats on my dashboard (number of doctors, nurses, patients, scans, symptoms, records per doctor, and patients per doctor) so that I can monitor system usage and performance effectively.

  - Demo: 
    - As an external doctor/hospital, I want to request a demo account so that I can try the system before subscribing.
  
  - Admin: 
    - As a system admin, I want to see the total revenue and yearly revenue so that I can track the system’s financial performance.
    - As a system admin, I want to see revenue generated specifically from external doctors so that I can measure the success of demo feature.
    - As a system admin, I want to see the total number of hospitals, doctors, nurses, and patients so that I have an overview of system usage.
    - As a system admin, I want to view, edit, and delete hospitals and see their full details so that I can maintain accurate system records.
    - As a system admin, I want to filter hospitals by subscription type or status so that I can quickly find specific hospitals.
    - As a system admin, I want to view requests from external doctors who want demo access and approve or reject them so that I control who can use the system.
