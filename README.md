# Efaqah

# Project Description:
    “Efaqa” is a Brain Stroke Early Detection Platform which is a simple hospital portal where clinicians upload a head CT, see an instant stroke / no-stroke flag that will be detected using deep learning , and confirm with a quick symptoms check using machine learning, all on one screen.
    
    It uses two smart checks:
    - a symptoms-based check (from a short form) that gives a quick Risk         %,and.
    - a CT-image check that reads the scan and shows a Likely / Unlikely        result with a confidence number and key slices.

# User Storeis: 
    - Nurse: 
      - As a nurse, I want to add a new patient profile (name, age, ID,           medical history basics) so that the doctor has the case ready for         review.
      
      - As a nurse, I want to record the patient’s symptoms (face                drooping,arm weakness, speech issues, time started, vitals,               medications) sothat the system can generate a stroke risk %.
      
      - As a nurse, I want to view the patient’s medical record and past          visits so that I can provide accurate details to the doctor.
      
      - As a nurse, I want to update patient details when new information         is available so that the record stays accurate and complete.

    - Doctor: 
      - As a doctor, I want to upload a patient’s CT scan so that I can           quickly see if there is a likely stroke or not.
      
      - As a doctor, I want to see a confidence score (%) and CT so that          I can trust and validate the system’s result.
      
      - As a doctor, I want to see key symptoms (face drooping, arm               weakness, speech, time of onset, BP, glucose, medications) so             that the system can calculate a quick stroke risk %.
      
     - As a doctor, I want to see both (CT check + symptoms risk) results        on one screen so that I can make a faster and more reliable               decision.
     
     - As a doctor, I want to generate a one-page report (summary of             scan, symptoms, risk %) so that I can document the case and share         with colleagues.
     
     - As a doctor, I want to view the patient’s medical record and past         visits so that I can provide accurate details to the doctor.
     
     - As a doctor with manager privileges , I want to track how many            stroke scans are uploaded per day so that I can monitor system            usage.
